Solar Energy Equity Management System
Sema aims to track , regulate  and ensure equitable distribution of generated renewable electricity.
India is densely populated country with major electricity consumers associated with apartments , slums and agriculture. Due to unavability of open lands for solar installation only a few people reaps the benifits. 
SEEMA takes electricity generation and consumption data from the nodes on blockchain which have solar panel installed to fulfill the requirement of the recever/buyer.

Particularly blockchain is used to form a decentralized , transparent and peer to peer power tracking network.

Our key feature is that the high production solar houses can sell there  auxillary energy to the reciever who need additional energy  whether they has solar panel installed or not.

SEEMA is based on blockchain so there is no centralized authority so the energy transfer will occur peer to peer, meter box to meter box.
